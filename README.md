# Configuration as a Service Repository
This repository models how a remote git configuration repository for CaaS should be.

CaaS is an initiative to centralize application configuration in the enterprises, built with ideas borrowed from spring cloud config, 
but augmented with experience building enteprise-grade solutions in big corporations.
* See [Configuration Service Connector](https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/configuration-service-connector) For integration with MuleESB 3.x
* See [Configuration Service](https://github.com/juancavallotti/caas) For Java implementation.
